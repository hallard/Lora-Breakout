RFM92 RFM95 RFM96 RFM98 Lora breakout board NRF24L01 socket
===========================================================

This is a utility breakout board for connecting Lora device onto 
NRF24L01 sockets

this breakout add the feature of one of : 
- **adding** ATSHA SPI Flash EEProm
- **adding** a Led to see what's going on


Breakout comes in two versions, one with classic 2x4 PTH connector and the other with the same
but SMD version of the connector, this permit to have the PCB quite the same size of the original
RFM modules size. Oh, also these boards are rounded instead of corners.

This has been created to work with [ULPNode][7] Project and [ArduiPi][4] Project, but this breakout
can be used anywhere where you use NRF24L01 or has NRF24L01 connector.

The same breakout board exists also for RFM69W and RFM69HW on this [repo][2] and for RFM12B on this [one][1]
